# AI Agents as Distributed Cognitive Systems
### *A bridge between AI, neuroscience, and governance*


<br>

This text reframes the [*AI Agents in Action*]() white paper through a lens inspired by cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and distributed systems theory.  Instead of treating agents only as software components, it proposes understanding them as artificial cognitive units that interact, cooperate, and self‑regulate in complex environments.[^1]

This shift in perspective is essential for designing, evaluating, and governing AI agents in a sustainable way.
