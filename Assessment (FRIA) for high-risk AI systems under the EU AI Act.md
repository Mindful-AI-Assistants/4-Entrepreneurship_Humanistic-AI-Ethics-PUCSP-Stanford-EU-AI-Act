This guide supports organizations, especially public authorities, in conducting a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) for high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act. 
The process is structured into five phases: Planning and Scoping, Assess and Mitigate Negative Impacts, Deployment Decision and Public Reporting, Monitoring and Review, and the cross-cutting phase of Consulting Affected Groups and Stakeholders.
Key elements include developing scenarios to identify impacted rights, assessing the severity and likelihood of negative impacts, and establishing robust mitigation measures such as human oversight and accessible complaint mechanisms.
